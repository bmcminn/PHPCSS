# PHP-to-CSS
*Author:* Brandtley McMinn -- http://giggleboxstudios.net

## OVERVIEW:
This is a PHP based system for generating CSS dynamically without relying on SASS or SCSS. I wanted a simple way to generate CSS that supported variables, custom functions/mixins and anything else I could think of, like CSS grid generation.

Thusfar, what I've come up with is a simple, self-generating script that unifies ALL your CSS content into one http request and is completely customizable. Enjoi :{P

## INSTALLATION:

The script is pretty simple to setup and should only take a couple minutes. I'm still working out kinks to make it setup agnostic, which is tricky considering PHP configs differ from server to server. (See TROUBLESHOOTING should you have issues)
